# Fundamentals of Algorithms (FAL) - Complutense University of Madrid (UCM)

## Course Overview

The **Fundamentals of Algorithms (FAL)** course, offered by the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM), introduces the design, specification, and implementation of core algorithmic paradigms. The course aims to build a solid foundation in computational thinking, enabling students to approach complex problems systematically.

## Topics Covered

1. **Iterative Algorithms**
   - **Design**: Understanding how to develop solutions based on loops and repetitive structures.
   - **Specification**: Writing precise problem descriptions and expected outcomes.
   - **Implementation**: Translating designs into executable code using control structures like `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

2. **Recursive Algorithms**
   - **Introduction to Recursion**: Solving problems by defining base cases and recursive relations.
   - **Applications**: Examples include factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence, and tree traversals.
   - **Performance Analysis**: Understanding time and space complexity in recursive calls.

3. **Divide and Conquer**
   - **Concept**: Breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving them recursively, and combining the solutions.
   - **Classic Examples**:
     - Binary Search
   - **Advantages**: Efficient handling of large datasets by leveraging parallelism.

4. **Backtracking**
   - **Definition**: Exploring all possible solutions by building candidates and abandoning those that fail to satisfy constraints.
   - **Optimization**: Reducing the search space to improve efficiency.
